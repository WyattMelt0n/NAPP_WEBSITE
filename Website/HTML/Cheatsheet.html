    <!--This program will demonstrate what the F21-99-NAPP
      group has currently learned in the topics of HTML, JavaScript, and little
      bit of CSS.

      For this page, we will include the form that includes 1 input and 1
      button. The user will type in a number, then click the submit button.

      When the Submit button is pressed, the JavaScript program will first check
      if the input is either a negative number or isn't an number. If either
      conditions doesn't occur, the program will do a simple calculation and print
      it onto the HTML document.
      Otherwise an alert will appear and no further actions will be taken.-->

          For a better understanding of the math behind Jeff Novick's guidelines,
          this page will allow you set a positive amount on the slider bar.
          <br>From there, you can see the recommended amount of each nutritional value.
